      <h1>Welcome to Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        We are Adrian Pardo and Julian Reyes, the visionary minds behind an

        <h2>Our Journey Begins</h2>
        <p>
          It all started during a Software Design class at AIU, where our paths crossed.
          Fueled by a shared passion for technology, we embarked on a mission to
          enhance the student experience.

        <h2>The Spark of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Late-night coding sessions fueled by caffeine inspired us to do our best to clone Instagram
          so that we may pass with bright colors our class exam.

          Nights filled with lines of code and endless cups of coffee became the
          norm as we worked to bring our vision to life.
